Amazing — this is a perfect foundation for the **Arden Core Vocabulary**. Here's how we’ll proceed:

---

## **✅ Translation Process Overview**

### **1\. Categorize by Type**

You’ve already done this (thank you\!), so I’ll keep those groupings and work section by section: nouns → verbs → adjectives → etc.

### **2\. Apply Arden Morphological Rules**

* **Nouns:** end in a consonant (base form), with *\-a* (nominative), *\-am* (accusative), *\-um* (genitive), *\-ee* (plural)  
* **Verbs:** end in *\-e* (infinitive), with *\-o* (past), *\-bo* (future)  
* **Adjectives:** end in *\-el*, go after nouns, with optional plural *\-ee*, and comparative *\-ar* / superlative *\-estel*  
* **Pronunciation:** will follow the phonetic rules and consonant guidelines from your language spec

### **3\. Invent Roots That Sound “Arden”**

I’ll keep phonotactics clean and consistent — naturalistic but unique. Think a bit of a blend between Latin, Welsh, and your own poetic logic.

### **🔜 Next Step:**

I’ll begin with the **first category — Animal** — and generate Arden words for it, then check with you before proceeding. This ensures you like the style and feel.

Would you like me to continue on to the next category (**Transportation**), or do you want to tweak any of these first?
