-- ou as in 'house'

5 - **Nasalization:**

6 - **Punctuation:**  
  - Utilize standard English punctuation marks (periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points).

7 - **Question Mark Indicator:**  
  - Use a question mark at both the beginning and end of a sentence as a visual indicator for questions.  
  - Example: "?Why are you so late?"

11 - **Apostrophes and Other Characters:**  
  - Use standard English characters for other necessary characters. if at all possible, avoid apostrophes. Will need a mechanism to show possessive. Best mechanism is to use 'de' and 'yun' to indicate possessive. This is similar to the German use of 'von'. So in Ardan it would be \<noun\> de \<object\> or \<noun\> yun \<object\>. This possessiveness indicator would come before the object.

12 - **Word Order:**  
   - Adopt a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. This means that sentences are structured with the subject first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

   Example: "The cat catches the mouse."  
   - Subject: The cat  
   - Verb: catches  
   - Object: the mouse

13 - **Noun Declensions:**  
   - Simplify noun declensions compared to Latin. Use a basic system where nouns have a singular and plural form, with optional cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, and genitive).

Noun Rules:

- All nouns end in a consonant  
- All plurals end in ee  
- All nominatives end in a  
- All accusatives end in am  
- All genitives end in um

Examples:  
   - Singular: caalin (girl)  
   - Plural: caalinee (girls)

   - Nominative: caalina (the girl)  
   - Accusative: caalinam (the girl \[direct object\])  
   - Genitive: caalinum (of the girl)

-- Nominative Noun: The cat is sleeping. ("The cat" is the subject.)  
-- Nominative Pronoun: He is going to the store. ("He" is the subject.)  
-- Nominative Adjective: Happy people make the best friends. ("Happy" describes the subject "people.")

-- Genitive Noun: John's car is fast. ("John's" indicates possession.)  
-- Genitive Pronoun: This is Mary's book. ("Mary's" indicates possession.)  
-- Genitive Adjective: The color of the sky is blue. ("Of the sky" indicates origin or association.)

-- Accusative Noun: I saw the movie. ("The movie" is the direct object.)  
-- Accusative Pronoun: She loves him. ("Him" is the direct object.)  
-- Accusative Adjective: He painted the wall red. ("The wall" is the direct object of the action "painted.")

14 - **Verb Conjugations:**

Verb Rules:

- All verbs end in -e for example amare (to love)  
- Present verb conjugations are not needed because you can just use the root verb form  
- Past verb conjugations end in -o as in me amaro ( I loved) tu amaro (you loved), mile amaro (he loved), mila amaro (she loved), and se amaro (person loved)  
- Future verb conjugations end in -bo as in me amarbo (I will love), tu amarbo (you will love), mile amarbo (he will love), mila amarbo (she will love), and se amarbo (person will love)


   - Keep verb conjugations straightforward. Use a limited set of verb conjugations for tense (past, future)

 Example: amare (to love)  
   - Present: me amare (I love), tu amare (you love), mile/mila/se amare (he/she/person loves)  
   - Past: me amaro (I loved), tu amaro  (you loved), mile/mila/se amaro (he/she/person loved)  
   - Future: me amarbo (I will love), tu amarbo (you will love), mile/mila/se amarbo (he/she/person will love)

15 - **Articles:**

- Articles come before the object they describe

-- Definite  
   - Singular: an (this)  
   - Plural: na (those)

-- Indefinite  
   - Singular: te (a/an) // maybe default this  
   - Plural: et (some)

16 - **Pronouns:**  
   - Include a set of pronouns for personal and possessive relationships. Ensure they align with the noun declensions.

-- Personal Pronouns:**  
   - Singular: me (I), tu (you), mile/mila/se (he/she/person/it)  
   - Plural: muid (we), siv (you all), siad (they)

-- Possessive Pronouns:**  
   - Singular: mo (my), doo (your), aaj/aasee (his/her/*/its)  
   - Plural: ar (our), bhur (your all's), acu (their)

   - Meus/mea/meum (my), tuus/tua/tuum (your), suus/sua/suum (his/her/its)

17 - **Prepositions:**  
   - Use prepositions to indicate relationships between words. Keep it simple with common prepositions like "in," "ad," "le," and "eks."  
   - Prepositions come before the noun or pronoun they describe

   Example:  
   - In dom (in the house), Ad amicum (to the friend), Le lib (with the book), Eks ter (from the land)

18 - **Consonent Digraphs:**

-- dd has the sound th as in 'this'  
-- zz has the sound zh as in 'azure'

20 - **Adjectives:**

Adjective Base Form  
All adjectives end in -el in their base form. This gives them a distinct look and feel compared to nouns and verbs.

Example:

- garnel (red)  
- santel (wise)  
- nimel (bright)

Adjectives will remain gender-neutral and will not change based on the gender of the noun.

   Example:  
   - Maadd (good) - used for both masculine and feminine nouns  
   - Alen (beautiful) - used for both masculine and feminine nouns

This way, the adjectives will be the same for both genders, promoting gender neutrality in your language. Feel free to adjust or expand upon these elements based on your preferences\!

Adjective Placement: Adjectives usually come after the noun they describe

Example:

- *duran garnel* \= "red mountain"  
- *farnum santel* \= "of the wise king"

Number Agreement:

Plural adjectives end in  -ee:

Singular → Plural  
garnel	→ garnelee  
santel	→ santelee  
nimel	→ nimelee

Comparative & Superlative Forms To express degrees of comparison, use these suffixes:

Comparative: -ar  
santel (wise) → santelar (wiser)  
nimel (bright) → nimelar (brighter)

Superlative: -estel  
santel → santelestel (wisest)  
nimel → nimelestel (brightest)

Helper Words:

“mor” \= more  
“seel” \= most

Examples:  
mor santel \= more wise  
seel nimel \= most bright

21 - **Pronunciation:**  
   - Established basic rules for vowel and consonant sounds, word stress with no stress pattern.

22 - **Intonation:**  
   - Outlined patterns for statement, question, neutral, exclamatory, emphatic, and list intonations, including support for complex sentences,  question and exclamatory tags.

23 - **Adverbs:**

   Example:  
   - "Mila xe gomol" (She goes slowly), where "gomol" (slowly) follows "Mila xe" (she goes).
