</ul>
<p>-- oi as in 'boy'<br />
-- ou as in 'house'<br />
-- au as in 'song'</p>
<p>5 - <strong>Nasalization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indicate nasalized vowels with specific letters (e.g., an, en, in, on, un).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no nasalized vowels at this point</p>
<p>6 - <strong>Punctuation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize standard English punctuation marks (periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points).</li>
</ul>
<p>7 - <strong>Question Mark Indicator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a question mark at both the beginning and end of a sentence as a visual indicator for questions.</li>
<li>Example: &quot;?Why are you so late?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>8 - <strong>Exclamation Mark Indicator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an exclamation mark at both the beginning and end of a sentence as a visual indicator for questions.</li>

</ul>
<p>9 - <strong>Spacing:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>11 - <strong>Apostrophes and Other Characters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use standard English characters for other necessary characters. if at all possible, avoid apostrophes. Will need a mechanism to show possessive. Best mechanism is to use 'de' and 'yun' to indicate possessive. This is similar to the German use of 'von'. So in Ardan it would be &lt;noun&gt; de &lt;object&gt; or &lt;noun&gt; yun &lt;object&gt;. This possessiveness indicator would come before the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>12 - <strong>Word Order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. This means that sentences are structured with the subject first, followed by the verb, and then the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: &quot;The cat catches the mouse.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Subject: The cat</li>
<li>Verb: catches</li>
<li>Object: the mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>13 - <strong>Noun Declensions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify noun declensions compared to Latin. Use a basic system where nouns have a singular and plural form, with optional cases (e.g., nominative, accusative, and genitive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Noun Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>All nouns end in a consonant</li>
<li>All plurals end in ee</li>

<li>All accusatives end in am</li>
<li>All genitives end in um</li>
</ul>

<p>Verb Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All verbs end in -e for example amare (to love)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present verb conjugations are not needed because you can just use the root verb form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past verb conjugations end in -o as in me amaro ( I loved) tu amaro (you loved), mile amaro (he loved), mila amaro (she loved), and se amaro (person loved)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future verb conjugations end in -bo as in me amarbo (I will love), tu amarbo (you will love), mile amarbo (he will love), mila amarbo (she will love), and se amarbo (person will love)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep verb conjugations straightforward. Use a limited set of verb conjugations for tense (past, future)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: amare (to love)</p>
<ul>
<li>Present: me amare (I love), tu amare (you love), mile/mila/se amare (he/she/person loves)</li>
<li>Past: me amaro (I loved), tu amaro  (you loved), mile/mila/se amaro (he/she/person loved)</li>
<li>Future: me amarbo (I will love), tu amarbo (you will love), mile/mila/se amarbo (he/she/person will love)</li>
</ul>
<p>15 - <strong>Articles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Articles come before the object they describe</li>
</ul>

<li>Prepositions come before the noun or pronoun they describe</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>

</ul>

-- zz has the sound zh as in 'azure'</p>
<p>20 - <strong>Adjectives:</strong></p>
<p>Adjective Base Form<br />
All adjectives end in -el in their base form. This gives them a distinct look and feel compared to nouns and verbs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>garnel (red)</li>
<li>santel (wise)</li>
<li>nimel (bright)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjectives will remain gender-neutral and will not change based on the gender of the noun.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maadd (good) - used for both masculine and feminine nouns</li>
<li>Alen (beautiful) - used for both masculine and feminine nouns</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, the adjectives will be the same for both genders, promoting gender neutrality in your language. Feel free to adjust or expand upon these elements based on your preferences!</p>
<p>Adjective Placement: Adjectives usually come after the noun they describe</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>duran garnel</em> = &quot;red mountain&quot;</li>
<li><em>farnum santel</em> = &quot;of the wise king&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Number Agreement:</p>
<p>Plural adjectives end in  -ee:</p>
<p>Singular → Plural<br />
garnel	→ garnelee<br />
santel	→ santelee<br />
nimel	→ nimelee</p>
<p>Comparative &amp; Superlative Forms To express degrees of comparison, use these suffixes:</p>
<p>Comparative: -ar<br />
santel (wise) → santelar (wiser)<br />
nimel (bright) → nimelar (brighter)</p>
<p>Superlative: -estel<br />
santel → santelestel (wisest)<br />
nimel → nimelestel (brightest)</p>
<p>Helper Words:</p>
<p>“mor” = more<br />
“seel” = most</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
mor santel = more wise<br />
seel nimel = most bright</p>
